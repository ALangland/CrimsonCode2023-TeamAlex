# CrimsonCode2023-TeamAlex
The full project of "Team Alex" for the 2023 Crimson Code Hackathon

This is a program designed to assist WSU Students in applying the "Pomodoro Technique" of studying.

This can be helpful for struggling students who want to "Try Something New" in improving their study habits, and it represents us trying something new in our implementation of APIs and GUIs.
